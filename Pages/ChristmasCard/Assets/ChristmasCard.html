      <h3> This interactive christmas card was made together with 
        <a href="https://deusthelp.my.canva.site/deusthelp " > 
          Arthur Godthelp 
        </a>
         in an assignment for creative technology module 2 in the course Programming & Physical.
         The goal for this assignment was create a card with text that could be manipulated.
         The other movements were extras to make the card more appealing.

      <h3> <ul style="font-size: 115%; margin-left: -45px;">
        <b>Instructions for the interactive christmascard: </b></ul>
        <li> Click on the snowglobe to "shake" it.</li>
        <li> Hover over the fireplace with the mouse to make a candle appear.</li>
        <li> Press the "L" key, on your keyboard, when then candle is on the log, the brown ellipse.</li>
      </h3>
      <h3> 
        The tool used to create this card was Processing version 4.3, revision 01293. 
        To make it work on a website the processing language is coverted to JavaScript, which makes it possible to have the interactiveness on a website. 
        The link down below is to download the orginial processing file, as a zip file. 
        To open this file and run it you need to have processing installed on your device.

      <h3> 
      The idea of the christmascard came very quickly as it was nearly christmas and we were excited for the christmas. 
      In contrast something which did not go smoothly was the goal of the assignment, making the text move. 
      Firstly the text was only moving down but, this made it look more like rain than snow.
      That is why decide to make the snow follow a very stretched sine wave.
      This is done because then you get the effect that the snow is whirling down. 
      To make sure there is difference between diffrent words, different snow particles the amplitude of the sinewave is randomized.
