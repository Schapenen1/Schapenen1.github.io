        <h3> 
            Before I started upcycling this nightstand, it was a nightstand on legs.
            These legs were longer extensions of the steel corner profiles, also it had already a lit built in.
            The acrylic panels were double the hieght of what they are right now.
            Sadly i could not find a picture of the original design of the nightstand.
        <br><br>
            While using this design i discovered that one of the drawers in my bed turned out to be unusable, if the nightstand was not moved.
            So then the choice was made to remove the legs and attach a construction to hold it while floating.
            Another design change was made to cut the square  orange acrylic pieces in half to make sure the nightstand had less height 
            and would better fit to the aesthetics of the rest of the room.
            Currently on the construction to make it floating is lying a power bar where the lamp is plugged in and a phone can be charged there.
